""" The script first imports the calendar module.

It then comments out a line that calculates the number of leap years between the years 2010 and 2022, using the leapdays() function of the calendar module.

The script then prints a welcome message and prompts the user to enter two years: year1 and year2. These years are converted to integers using the int() function.

The script then uses the leapdays() function of the calendar module to calculate the number of leap years between year1 and year2. The result is stored in the variable leaps.

Finally, the script prints a message that displays the number of leap years between the two input years.

Note that the leapdays() function returns the number of leap years in the range [y1, y2) (i.e., including y1 but not including y2). Therefore, the number of leap years between year1 and year2 is calculated as leaps = calendar.leapdays(year1, year2)"""
