#more about linked list (from a tutorial)

stock_prices=[235,654,879,345,888,769,871] #here is an array we create (we have to look first into arrays coz linked list are helping to solve the arrays problems and limitation)

stock_prices.insert(1,444)
# so here we are inserting the number 444 in the list at the index 1, which will push the existing numbers back to leave a space for the inserted number

#here the array insertion complexity are of order of n or O(n).

#when we create an epmty list like "list=[] it alocate a memory space for that list, python lists are dynamic arrays and here is allocated a space capacity of 5 element " and when we start inserting (here we are appending, adding values to the end of the list) values in the list, the values are filling those spaces allocated for the list... when we added three values and we want to add another value but at the location of an existing value, it will puch the existing to make a space for the new value

#now lets imagine that our array is full of capacity (capacity is = 5 and all the five are filled), when we want to insert a new value.. the way dynamic array works now is, since it cannot use other values memory location, it will go in some area of the memory (RAM) then it will allocate more capacity and then will copy all those elements one by one, so if the initial capacity is 5, it will allocate additional 5*2 =10 (or additional capacity 5*2=10) memory locations... now there are 15 capacity or memory locations


#THIS IS NOT THAT EFFICIENT THO 😥

#lets imagine a structure where values are stored into different areas of memory (linked list) .. here we have the    "| value | next value adress |" 

# first, arrays store the value in contegious mem. location while this (linked list) is storing them into random memory locations which are linked with a pointer which point to the next adress  ... so the first value has a reference side to the adress of the next value or element ... those are the links we are creating here.

#here it become much easier to insert a new value coz there is not a limitation of capacity for the array... now we are not copying from one location to another.

#here when we insert or delete element at the begining, the complexity is = O(1)  [this one is just because while inserting, its creating a node for the new element and the adress of the next element, so its iterating only once coz its the elements at the index 1]  and    when we want to insert or delete element at the end the complexoty is = O(n) because we have to iterate between all the elements of th list

#so, linked list has two main benefits over an array: 
# 1. you dont need to pre-allocate space and 2. insertion is easier

#there are also double linked-list (where its no longer |value |next address| but now its |previus adress| current value | next value adress) this allows to comeback easier, the backward traversal is easier .... the traversall of a list is O(n)

#the only advantage an array has is, if you know the index of the element in array on order of 1 (O(1)) which is a constant time operation.. so in array if you want to access the fifth element you just have to specify the index of the element into [] and it will go directly to it, but for linked list, it has to go through all the elements to follow the links 

#inserting/deleting elements at start in array is O(n) coz u have to copy all the elements, but for linked list it is O(1) ,  you dont need to.add()

#inserting elements in the middle is O(n) for both.add()

#    IN PYTHON NOW 😃: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#lets create two classes:

class Node: 
   def __init__(self,data=None,next=None): #this is the constructor of the Node class and has got two elements which construct the class (they are "data" and "next")
      self.data=data #this can contain integers, numbers, or complex objects
      self.next=next #this is a pointed to the next eelement
      #this "node"class represent a single element in the linked-list (it has two class members which are data and next)
      
class LinkedList: 
   def __init__(self):
      self.head=None
      #this class is a class where we need a head variable which points to the head of the linked list (beginning)

#so now we start by adding a method (function called insert_at_begining)

   def insert_at_begining(self,data): #this is taking the data value and insert it at the beginning of the linked-list !!! THIS IS THE FIRST FUNCTION TO INSERT AT THE BEGINING OF A LINKED-LIST
      
      #LET US CREATE A NODE TO EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS
      node= Node(data,self.head) #this "self.head" is taking the place of the "next" which is the pointer to the next value of the list and here the "self head" is the "first pointer"
      
      #just to make things easier,lets say there is an existing head, when we add a new element(data), it will create a "node" where the "next" value will be the previous self.head which was pushed. (now it become the address of the next value and the current value is now the new node we created)  here the self.head is now the adress of the next value (which was our head value before we inserted anoter at the front) 
      
      #!!! REMEMBER, HERE THE "node" is an object we are creating and the "Node" is the class of the first value we created before 
      
      #so, here the self.head will be used in a case where, when we want to insert a new value or element, this self.head will be automatically the pointer to the value that was pushed (here will be the adress of the value we pushed so that the next value will be this one we pushed and that is by using its adress to point at it) and
      
      #so, the data in "node=Node(data,self.head)" is the new value we are inserting and the adress which will be in that node will be the adress of the next value (or next element)
      
      #so, lets say we already have a head, and if we are inserting anything (any new data) infront of it, what gonna happen is, we will create a new "node" element (which is an object from the Node class) and the next value of that node will be the current head of the existing value that will be pushed (here there is not yet another element which is pusshing the new element)
      
      self.head=node
      #here, its easy, we are simply saying that , now, since the new node is created, it become our new head (so that, if we want to insert another new element, this one will be pushed also and let the new node be the new head, and the self.head of that new new element will be the adress of the previously created element)
      
      #in other words, here we are saying that our new head adress is the adress of the newly created "node", this will be used when we will create a new element so that it will be the "next" adress of the newly created node(which has a data and the adress of the pushed node) ... I REPEAT 🙏 the self.head of the newly created node will be the adress of the node we inserted earlier.
      
      #!!!!! PAY ATTENTION!!! in all the functions we are creating,we are using the "self" keyword in the parameter parentheses (i will explain it a bit later 😊)
      
      #so here we still in the same class remember, and to verify this insert_at_begining() function, we have to use the utility function called print:
   def print(self):
      if self.head is None: #means there is not any alredy existing head in the lonked-list
         print("linked list is empty")
         return #this return is to break the condition after its verified
            #here, what we just did is that we create this function print so that, if the linked list, where we want to insert a new element or data, is empty, then it will tell us
            #whith this return, we dont need to use the elif again, we can just set the other condition directly
      itr=self.head #here we mean, if head exist, we store it in itr (itterator)
      llstr="" # "linkedliststring", this is the list where all the elements will be stored after being itterated
      while itr: #while its true or its exist .. we will itterate through the whole list
         llstr+=str(itr.data) + ' --> ' #so here the data which is being itterated will be stored in llstr then we go to the next value ( <-- : this is the direction of itteration)
            #the '-->' is just to show the link (it can be removed without problem 😊)
         itr=itr.next #here we say, now since there are an existing head, that head will become the "next" of the new "self.head =  the new value... so the itr become itr.next (next of the self.head or the new head) remember that it is like that coz we stored the self.head in itr (we stored the already exiating one in itr so that we can easily transform it into the "next" or the adress of the next value)
            
            #anoher way to understand it very well is that, while printing, it will start by the last value in the list, verify if it is a head, then turn it into the "next" adress of the coming value to be analised by the printing function... for it, it will be iterrated and become the "next" then we go to the other value (from right to left <-- ) and keep itterating until it reaches the last value to see if there is a head which keep existing after the value we are at, if there is not any value, then the while loop is broken (no head existing after the value we are at so it cannot make the current value the "next" adress of a non existing value)
            
            #WE ARE ITTERATING THROUGH ELEMENTS ONE BY ONE (dirrection: <-- )
            #and for each itteration, the value that is made "next" will be printed after being itterated (and that will make our output)
      print(llstr) #here, after the loop was broken, we print the linked list with the added elements #!!! SO NOW, TO CHECK THIS, WE HAVE TO CREATE A LINKED LIST NAME TO BE USED IN THE PRINTING PROCCESS!!!
         
         #NOW WE ARE TRYING TO INSERT AND PRINT THE LINKED LIST
         #THERE IS A SMALL PROBLEM WITH THE PROGRAM THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT SOON BUT FOR NOW, THIS IS HOW THE CODE IS SUPPOSED TO E WRITEN and printed
         
         #😁 The error was finally solved, it was a syntax error and not a logical error 😁
   
   
   def insert_at_end(self,data):
      if self.head is None: #if the list is empty, or there is not any head node in the list
                            # then the data we insert now will be the new head and after it there is not any value which can be the next (that is why we used the None)

                                 # data" which does not have any next value or is not pointing at any value since it is the only value in the linked list
                                 
                                 #reemeber for the insertion at the begining we used the "node" object Node(data,self.head) whith the self head as the next value, here, since we want to ad a value at the end if the list, there is not any "next" value that has to be after the adedd value
         return #this is to show that, since there is now only one value added, we will break the condition just after we added the the single value

      itr.next=Node(data,None) #here it means that we reached the last element and for that element there is not a next value, then its next value will be the bew node we've created which does not have a next[ Node(data,None)], so after the loop is broken, which means that there is not another next value existing after, we can now add our new element (which will be the "next" of the nast element which did not have a "next" before we added the new data)

   #THIRD EXERCICE: implementing a double linked list:
   
   
   
   
   
   
class Node:
   def __init__(self,data=None,next=None,prev=None):
      self.data=data
      self.next=next
      self.prev=prev
         
         #it is the same process as the prvious linked list, pass through the previous code before to start these questions please. FOR THESE ONES, TRY THEM LATER THEN FIND THE ANSWER IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE VIDEO "LINKED LIST : CODE BASICS channel"
         
   # then implement these two methods: 
   def print_forward(self):
      #this method prints lists in forward direction. use node.next.
      pass
   
   def print_backward(self):
      #print linked list in reverse direction. use node.prev for this.
      pass
   
#‼️‼️ implement all other methods in regular linked list class and make necessary changes for doubly linked list (you need to populate node.prev in all those methods)
   
   
   
   
      
      
      
      
      
      
ll=LinkedList()
ll.insert_at_begining(34) #this will be the first element to be inserted in the linkedlist
ll.insert_at_begining(23) #this will be the second and will push the (34) value and become the head
ll.insert_at_begining(44) #then this will come and push the (23) and then become the head
ll.insert_at_begining(20) #then this (20) will be inserted at the beginning too and push the (44) and become the head. 
#notice that, for the "insert_at_begining" the one which is inserted after the other is the one which become the head (so it is aded at the beginning of the linked list)

ll.insert_at_end(100) #this will be the first one to be added at the end of our list
ll.insert_at_end(130) #the this will come and be addedd after the (100) and become the "next" of (100)
ll.insert_at_end(141) #then this will also come and become the "next" of (130) 
                      # NOTICE that, if we dont hadd any value after (141), then it does not have a "next" and then it is ponting at nothing "None"
#ll.insert_values(["babane ","mangue ","tomato ","garlic"]) #here, as we saw, we erased all the previous content of the previous linked lists and created a new one with the inputed content,


ll.insert_after_value(54.6,400)
ll.insert_after_value(400,400)
ll.remove_by_value(65)


ll.print()
length=ll.get_length()
print(f"the length is equal to {length} ")

ll.remove_at(2) #here we are now using our new module to remove an element at a specific index
# ll.remove_at(20)  or ll.remove_at(-1) ...  for these ones, we will reveive an error message or raise exception error message "invalid index" coz we created a condition for such cases if you remember ... 
ll.insert_at(1,"kwanga")  
ll.print() #then this function comes and print the linked list while itterating through all the values until it reaches the value which does not have another value in after it (in front of it)
length=ll.get_length()
print(f"the length is equal to {length} ") #now we print the length like this after weve already stored it into a variable to use it in a much easier way.
