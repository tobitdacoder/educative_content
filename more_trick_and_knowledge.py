''' here lets use the "match" which is a syntax used to implement the same idea of conditional'''

#to use it, let us create a file where it promps the user name and display in which house of harry potter that persons name belongs:


name=input("what is your name: ")

if name =="harry":
   print("you're from gryffindor")
elif name=="hermione":
   print("gryffindor is your home")
elif name=="Ron":
   print("you're from gryffindor")
elif name=="draco":
   print("stythelin is where you belong")
else:
   print("who?")
   


#here we can write:
if name=="harry" or name=="hermione" or name=="ron":
   print("you're from gryffindor")





#here to avoid big work when we have a lot pf name to compare too we use another method called "match"


#IT IS DONE LIKE THIS: 
name=input("what is your name: ")
match name:
   case "harry":
      print("gryffindor")
   case "hermione":
      print("gryffindor")
   case "ron":
      print("gryffindor") 
   case "draco":
      print("slytherin")
   #here instead of default, we use "case_"
   case _:
      print("who the hell are you?!?!")
      
#but to condence it we can still use this form down here:

name=input("what is your name: ")
match name:
   case "harry"| "hermione"|"ron":
      print("gryffindor")
   case "draco":
      print("slytherin")
   #here instead of default, we use "case_"
   case _:
      print("who the hell are you?!?!")
#this ðŸ‘† is how we can use the match statement in stead of using the same "if statement"

   
def password(): 
   pass_list=["tobit","me","myself"]
   names=str(input("enter the password: "))
   if names in pass_list:
      print("you're allowed")
   else:
      print("GO OUT!!!!")
password()


times=int(input("enter the number of time u want the word 'me' have to be printed: "))
print("me\n"*times,end="")
#this end in the print statement will help us eliminate the space after the "side effect"






while True:
   
   n=int(input("enter the n: "))
   if n<=0:
      print("a positive number please")
      continue
   else:
      break
   
for _ in range(n):
   print("great")
#this will first oblige the user to enter a positive number also diferent to zero so that it can print the word "n" times depending on the users absolute positive input 




#this ðŸ‘† same code can be writen like this tooðŸ‘‡(HERE IS WHEN WE WANT TO DO THE ACTION AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN, UNTIL THE USER GIVES US THE EXPECTED TYPE OF INPUT ðŸ‘‡:

while True:
   
   n=int(input("enter the n: "))
   if n>0:
      break
      #this break has got the power of breaking the loop at the moment that the condition (if statement) will be met
   
for _ in range(n):
   print("great")
   
#we can even go ahead and create our "meow" function:

def main():
   times=int(input("enter the number of times: "))
   meow(times)
def meow(n):
   for _ in range(n):
      print("meow")
main()


#we can also devellop the way of getting the input in this same main function by creating another function called "get_number()"

def main():
   number=get_number()
   meow(number)


def get_number():
   while True:
      n=int(input("enter the number of times u want to print the world: "))
      if n>0:
         return n
         #here we are use "return" instead of break because the return statement not only break the loop but also returns our n when the user gave us the wanted input type 
         
         #we can also still use the "break", then use the "return n" outside of the while loop
def meow(n):
   for _ in range(n):
      print("meow")
main()
