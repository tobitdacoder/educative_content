''' here lets use the "match" which is a syntax used to implement the same idea of conditional'''

#to use it, let us create a file where it promps the user name and display in which house of harry potter that persons name belongs:


name=input("what is your name: ")

if name =="harry":
   print("you're from gryffindor")
elif name=="hermione":
   print("gryffindor is your home")
elif name=="Ron":
   print("you're from gryffindor")
elif name=="draco":
   print("stythelin is where you belong")
else:
   print("who?")
   


#here we can write:
if name=="harry" or name=="hermione" or name=="ron":
   print("you're from gryffindor")





#here to avoid big work when we have a lot pf name to compare too we use another method called "match"


#IT IS DONE LIKE THIS: 
name=input("what is your name: ")
match name:
   case "harry":
      print("gryffindor")
   case "hermione":
      print("gryffindor")
   case "ron":
      print("gryffindor") 
   case "draco":
      print("slytherin")
   #here instead of default, we use "case_"
   case _:
      print("who the hell are you?!?!")
      
#but to condence it we can still use this form down here:

name=input("what is your name: ")
match name:
   case "harry"| "hermione"|"ron":
      print("gryffindor")
   case "draco":
      print("slytherin")
   #here instead of default, we use "case_"
   case _:
      print("who the hell are you?!?!")
#this 👆 is how we can use the match statement in stead of using the same "if statement"
