#print(myString[:4]) #here the emplty space before the colomn will be filled by the default value which is 0.
#print(myString[:]) #here we will get the entire string 

#this is cool but it still very manual and can be challenging when strings are bigger

#print(myString[ : :1]) #here we want to add the gap (here is the indexes that will be jumped before to print the next index)

#print(myString[ : :-1]) #here we are going backward
print("welcome back",myString.split()[0]) #this function turns the string into a list of individual strings separated by the space char ... the index there now allows us to use different parts of that whole string
