  """Let's break down the appending for loop in this code step by step:

1. `for i in range(len(word)):`:
   - This line sets up a for loop that iterates through each index ('i') in the range from 0 to the length of the `word` string minus 1.
   - The purpose of this loop is to check each letter in the `word` string.

2. 'if letter == word[i]:':
   - This line checks if the 'letter' guessed by the user is equal to the character at index 'i' in the 'word' string.
   - It compares the guessed letter with each letter in the `word` string to determine if there is a match.

3. 'progress = progress[:i] + letter + progress[i+1:]':
   - This line updates the 'progress' string based on the outcome of the comparison.
   - If the guessed letter matches the letter at index 'i' in the 'word' string, it replaces the corresponding underscore ('_') in the 'progress' string with the guessed letter, preserving the correct guesses made so far.
   - It does this by constructing a new string 'progress' using string slicing.
   - 'progress[:i]' retrieves the substring of 'progress' from the beginning up to (but not including) index 'i'.
   - 'letter' is the guessed letter.
   - 'progress[i+1:]' retrieves the substring of 'progress' starting from index 'i+1' up to the end of the string.
   - By concatenating these three parts together, the line creates an updated 'progress' string with the correct guesses filled in.

4. 'print(progress)':
   - After each iteration of the for loop, this line prints the updated 'progress' string to show the current state of the guessed word.
   - This allows the user to see the progress they have made and any correct letters they have guessed so far.

The for loop iterates through each letter of the 'word' string, checking if the guessed letter matches each letter in the word. If there is a match, it updates the 'progress' string accordingly. After each iteration, the updated 'progress' string is printed to show the current state of the guessed word. This process continues until the user has guessed all the correct letters and 'progress' matches the 'word' string completely."""

  #print("\nyou've already found this one")

#########################################
#here are some functions we can use for string manipulation:
# .split() to split the string into parts and can print the different parts using the indexing system 

#example:
sentense="we are the guyzz"
print(sentense.split()[2]) #here we are printing the word at the index 2 which is "the"

#you can use this technique to print in pretty maners like greetings, tests, exams, welcome messages or writing emails after getting the full name of the receiver (this function does the task called "STRING SLICING")

#other functions are .upper()
#                    .lower()
#                    .title()
#                    .capitalize()
#                    .strip() this is to erase the empty spaces arround the strings coz epmty space is also an element, so we use .strip() to eliminate those empty spaces.

#we can mix them like this too : print(sentense.split().capitalize()

# DICTIONARIES FUNDAMENTALS IN PYTHON 

#today we talk about the core basics of dictionaries. these comes o solve the LIST problems where by, with lists we put elements in an order and that order is accessed numerically by numbers [and that is not always what we want], because we will have to remember the index or the location of the element in the list, WHICH IS A LITTLE CONFUSING... that is why dictionaries comes in useful ... basically we just assign keys to values then those values are accessed by calling the key in the print function.

#simple dictionary:

Users = {"name": "tobit", "age": "23"} # here "name" and "age" are the keys and, respectively, "tobit" and "23" are the values stored inside those keys
Users['age']="21" # here is how we change a value stored in a specific key 
print(Users['age']) #here is how to print the dictionary content
print(f"his name is {Users['name']} and he is {Users['age']}") #here is how to use the f string... it is by making sure the keys are in '' single quotes

##############################

# here is a simple program that gets credentials input from the user, stores them in a dictionary and then use them to output a customized CONTACT CARD

import os, time

title = "CONTACT CARD"
print(f"{title:^80}")

time.sleep(3)
os.system("clear")

# 1# we get the credentials input from the user:
# then we store them into these variables:

name = input("what is your name: ")
DoBirth = input("what is your DoBirth: ")
email = input("what is your email: ")
adress = input("what is your adress: ")

time.sleep(2)
os.system("clear")

# 2# then we now create a dictionary in which the previous variables we created will be used as values of the dictionary's keys

DetailsDic = {
  "Name": name,
  "Date_of_birth": DoBirth,
  "Emails": email,
  "Adress": adress
}

# 3# then we use the keys in the f string to print the inputs from the dictionary directly .. this is how we do access the values:

print("here is your contact card\n")
print(f"Name: {DetailsDic['Name']}")
print(f"Date of birth: {DetailsDic['Date_of_birth']}")
print(f"Email: {DetailsDic['Emails']}")
print(f"Adress: {DetailsDic['Adress']}")
#DICTIONARY  #[KEY]
print()

# those informations can be reused evn after because they are already stored inside the dictionary

# now dictionaries and how to use loops to iterate into the values inside

myDictionary = {"name" : "Ian", "health": "219", "strength": "199", "equipped": "Axe"}

for i in myDictionary:

  #here is how we print only the keys in a dictionary

print()
for i in myDictionary:
    print(myDictionary[i])
    #here is how we access the values of a dictionary.. if you remember very well, we used previously this syntax 'print(myDictionary[i])'  where i was the nake of a key placed in single quote and the output was the value associated with that key.... the i repressnt the key

  #now, we are replacing the key in quotes by the index which is equal to = key but without quotes 

#ANOTHER WAY TO ACCESS THE VALUES DIRECTLY IS LIKE THIS:
print()
for valueee in myDictionary.values():
                        #  .keys():
  print(valueee)
  if valueee.lower()=="axe":
    print(" THIS IS DANGEROUS")
print()
  #the .values() function picks only the values from the dictionary and returns them ... without using the index

  #the .keys() function picks only the keys from the dictionary and returns them ... without using the index


# if we want to obtain both the key and the value we do like this:
count=0
for key,value in myDictionary.items():
  count+=1
  print(f"{count} {key} : {value}")
  #the .item() function helps to return both the key and the value at the same time ... the .items() function always need two variabes which are both the key and the value (you can name them as you want in the loop)

  #from here we can use the variables to do some stuff like:
  if key=="strength":
    print("you're strong!")
