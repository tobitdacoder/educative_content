] #here we are introducing the concept of accessing a list by using the index number of the row and the column
# elements,here we are using what is callrd a 2d list (which means that we have two dimensions used which are the rows
# columns)

#this is called a 2D list, it is a list which elements are also lists, and to access the content, we use this function
# comand below ðŸ‘‡

print(number_grid[2][5])
print(number_grid[1][2])

#here the [1][2]:
# the [1] is the index of the row and the [2] is the index of the colomn... both indicates the element 6.

this code will be improved while i will be learning new ways of using the 2d_list
